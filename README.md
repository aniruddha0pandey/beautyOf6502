# My Computer
Actually the name **beautyOf6502** is misleading. This isn't some *MOS processors* project, it's just I like the name, and impact these technologies stood influenced in the late 90s from powering *Atari 2600* to *Apple II*. These "*Processors*" ones requires room full of space to fit, now can be integrated with whole computer architecture in our fingertips, became so small given the name "*Microprocessor*". But what I intent here is the opposite, building one to the level of monstrosity.

Also I want to build something from what I've learned, going to learn in the process and check if **I** can. This is my attempt to make a full working **8-Bit Computer** straight from ICs, resitors and other electronic components.
