# My Computer
Actually the name **beautyOf6502** is misleading. This isn't some *MOS processors* project, it's just I like the name, and impact these technologies stood influenced put at late 90s from powering *Atari 2600* to *Apple II*. These processors which ones requires room full of space now can integrate the whole computer architecture in our fingertips, became so small given the name *microprocessor*. But what I intent here is the opposite, building one to the level of monstrosity.

Also I want to build something from what I've learned so far and check if I can. This is my attempt to make a full working **8-Bit Computer** straight from ICs, resitors and other.

- [James Newman](http://www.megaprocessor.com/)
- [The MOnSter 6502](https://monster6502.com/)
- The [Javascript Simulator](http://visual6502.org/JSSim/) build and the reverse engineering by [Visual 6502 Team](http://visual6502.org/). And their generous thought of [open source](https://github.com/trebonian/visual6502).
