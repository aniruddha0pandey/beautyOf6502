# My Computer
Actually the name **beautyOf6502** is misleading. This isn't some MOS processors project, it's just I like the name and the impact this technology put at that time from powering *Atari 2600* to *Apple II*.
Also I want to build something from what I've learned so far and check if I can. This is my attempt to make a full working **8-Bit Computer** straight from ICs, resitors and other.

# Motivation
- [James Newman](http://www.megaprocessor.com/)
- [The MOnSter 6502](https://monster6502.com/)
- The [Javascript Simulator](http://visual6502.org/) build and the reverse engineering by [Visual 6502 Team](https://github.com/trebonian/visual6502)
